# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Osdag on Cloud






Osdag on cloud is a cloud-based stage that offers a set-up of devices for planning and examining steel associations in primary designing tasks. The stage was created by the Indian Organization of Innovation, Bombay (IITB) and is kept up with by the Osdag people group.

The stage is intended to improve on the plan and examination process for steel associations, lessening the time and cost expected to finish primary designing tasks. It is basically focused on specialists, designers, and development experts who work on projects including steel structures. These experts can utilize Osdag on cloud to plan and examine steel associations for a great many designs, like structures, spans, and modern offices.

One of the critical highlights of Osdag on cloud is its easy to use interface. The stage gives a scope of plan choices for steel associations, including darted and welded associations, as well as end-plate, blade plate, and graft associations. Clients can choose the fitting steel segment, characterize the association type, and really look at the association's solidarity and soundness.

Osdag on cloud likewise furnishes clients with admittance to a library of standard associations. These standard associations can be modified to meet the particular prerequisites of a venture, in this way saving time and exertion in the plan cycle. The stage likewise advances joint effort among colleagues, as it permits different clients to chip away at a similar task at the same time, no matter what their area.

The stage depends on a measured plan, which permits clients to add new modules and modify the stage as indicated by their prerequisites. This element makes the stage profoundly versatile and adaptable, as meeting the remarkable requirements of each project can be tweaked.

Osdag on cloud likewise gives a scope of investigation devices for steel associations, for example, really taking a look at the association's solidarity and strength, as well as its twisting way of behaving. These devices permit specialists and engineers to improve the plan of steel associations, it are protected and solid to guarantee that they.

Generally, Osdag on cloud is a significant stage for experts in the field of primary designing. Its easy to understand interface, adjustable plan, and scope of investigation devices make it an optimal stage for planning and dissecting steel associations for many designs. By working on the plan and examination process, Osdag on cloud assists with lessening the time and cost expected to finish primary designing activities, while guaranteeing that the designs are protected, dependable, and meet the particular prerequisites of each venture.
